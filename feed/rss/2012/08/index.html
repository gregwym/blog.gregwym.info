<description>As you can see, I changed the entire blog into english, except the posts I wrote before and the blog title. It doesn't mean I will not write in Chinese any more. It's because I thought, in order to be standing out among the people around North America, I gotta have something the North America people can read and understand.Just finished my 3B term @ University of Waterloo. Learnt a lot, worked a lot...Things that I was or is recently working on:
doGRT: Going to implement the iPad UI. Refactor the entire app if I have time.
Moe FM: Refactoring the entire app. Adding bunch of new features. (Hope you guys are still waiting for it)
CampusNav: It's the project we made for our Software Architecture class. I'm planning to push it to the App Store.
Yodo1 SDK: Review and help improve the SDK.
These should be able to keep me busy for my Summer, lol. Gotta stop playing around and start working now.Wish everyone has a nice summer.</description>
