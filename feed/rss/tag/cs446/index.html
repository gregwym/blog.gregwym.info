<description>Software Design Process ModelsDesign as search. Design spaces. Design state, goal structure, generative design operations, early quantitative evaluations, control of design process. Basic models of design (transformational, plan/architecture driven). Relationship to other life-cycle activities.Terms
Module: a collection of classes
Subsystem: a collection of classes with an interface
Design window: the time, which design decision have to be made
Service: the operation in common purpose, offered by a subsystem
Different Views
Analysis focus on the problem domain 


Analyst, end user, customer

Design focus on the solution domain 


designer, implementer

Goals
Designer 


Specify interface of subsystems
Usability
Reusability

Implementer 


implementer
Extender
User

Major Design Goals
Behavioural Model 


Concurrency
Resource Handling
Software Control

Structural Model 


Hardware/Software mapping
Data Management

Use Case Model 


Boundary Conditions (边缘情况)

Non Functional Requirements 


Feasibility (可行性)

A lot of others.Most of them involves trade off between each otherDecomposition
High cohesion
Low coupling
Architecture/Design RepresentationWhat should be represented (structure, behaviour)? Informal representations of design, examples of design notations. Formal representation of design. Domain specific architecture descriptions. Role of standards, reference architectures. Design documentation.Terms
Subsystem decomposition: identify subsystems, service, and their association in between
Architectural style: pattern for a subsystem decomposition
Software architecture: instance of a style. composed of components and connectors
Components: encapsulated subsystem, provides services
Connectors: Facilitate communication within software. Simple procedure calls or shared data accesses
-
Conceptual Arch
Concrete Arch
Evolution
Degradation 


Drift: add things to conceptual
Erosion: conflict to conceptual
Recover: determining from implementation

Architectural Style
Vocab of design elements
Set of config rules
Semantic interpretation
Benefits
Design/Code reuse
Visualization
Interoperability (WTH is this word…)
Style-specific analyses
Style Examples
Main program and subroutines
Object-Oriented Style
Layered Style
Virtual Machine Layers 


Closed/Open Layering

3/4-Tier
Client/Server
Peer-to-Peer
Batch Sequential
Pipes and Filters
Repository
Implicit Invocation
Publish-Subscribe
Event-Based
MVC
Interpreter
Sservice-Oriented Arch (SOA)
Architectural ModelArch Views and ViewpointsDifferent views should be consistent between each other.
Logical View 


UML component diagram

Physical View
Deployment View 


UML deployment diagram

Concurrency/Process View
Behavioral View 


UML collaboration diagram

Metamodel意会了, 但是不知道怎么总结…主要用来保证view之间的consistencyDesign Goals
Reduce Complexity
Scalability
Adaptability
Heterogeneity
Portability
Dependability 


Reliability
Availability
Robustness
Fault-tolerant

Detail design activities
Identify modules 


Data Flow Analysis (DFA)

Identify control structure 


Instantiation of modules
Management of base processes

Decide on overall control structure 


Centralized/Decentralized control

Address boundary control conditions
Address persistent data management
Address hardware/software mapping
Implement concurrency
Define access control
...继续ing...Design Plans/ArchitectureReview of small/medium scale plans (data structures, programming language structures, concurrency). Plans/architectures for common types of software systems (translators, embedded, real-time, user interface)....未开始...</description>
