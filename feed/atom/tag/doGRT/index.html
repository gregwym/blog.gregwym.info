<h3>Back to the time it works</h3><p>In my last release of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/dogrt-grt-bus-schedule/id495688038?mt=8">doGRT</a>, I was proudly announcing the AUTO UPDATE feature. The feature which would let my user updates the schedule data without update the entire app from the App Store. I spent quite a bit of time to implement this feature, and put the schedule data on a place that I thought will never let me down - Github.</p><p>Seriously, it was working like a charm. At least during the time I was testing it. Unfortunately, the feature died before anyone can actually try it out.</p><h3>What happened?</h3><p>Right before the schedule season change, Github put out a blog post saying "<a href="https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads">Goodbye, Uploads</a>". At the main while, they replaced the <a href="https://github.com/doLast/doGRT/downloads">Downloads Section</a> with <a href="https://github.com/doLast/doGRT/tags">Tags</a> and completely disabled the upload.</p><h3>So what does that mean?</h3><p>Even tho Github will keep the downloads page for 90 days, I cannot upload any new file to it. Cannot upload means I cannot tell my app "A newer version of schedule is available, go download it!!!!"</p><p>How sad is that`T_T</p><blockquote><p>Github, can't you tell me this a bit earlier? or allow upload for extra 90 days? sigh</p></blockquote><h3>What I'm going to do?</h3><p>First, I wanna say sorry to doGRT users. If it is not the case, you guys would have the hot and fresh holiday schedule in your hand now. This situation should have been avoided if I have left enough flexibility in my implementation.</p><p>Of course, I'm going to fix it! Going to release a quick fix version with Winter schedule first.</p><p>The more feature I'm working on:</p><ul>
<li>Day picker: Look up schedules for a specific day, so you can plan ahead.</li>
<li>Bus reminder: Remind you to catch/get off at a curtain bus stop</li>
<li>GRT Twitter message intergration</li>
</ul><p>Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/gregwym">@gregwym</a> on twitter about your suggestions. Or you can email me through the feedback button in the app.</p><p>Merry Christmas,<br />Greg</p>
